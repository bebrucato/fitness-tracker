# Fitness Tracker

## Description
This app is a fantastic tool to keep track of your workouts while also viewing your stats on the Dashboard page. On the Homepage, the user can select to enter a "New Workout" or "Continue Workout". If the user selects the "New Workout", they will first be prompted to select an exercise type, either Cardio or Resistance. 

So, when the user chooses Cardio, a drop-down form will appear and the user will need to input the Name of the exercise, the Distance (miles), and the Duration (minutes). 
Additionally, if the user were to choose Resistance for the exercise type, the drop-down form will prompt them for Exercise Name, Weight (lbs), Sets, Reps, and Duration (min).
After the user enters the information, they can select "Complete" to finish the workout, or "Add Exercise" to add another exercise to their log. 

Once they are redirected back to the Homepage, they will see their workout(s) logged under the "Last Workout". If the user wishes to take things a step further, they can visit the Dashboard and review charts that display the Workout Duration (min), Pounds Lifted, and Exercises Performed for both Resistance and Cardio.

By utilizing mongoDB and mongoAtlas, this app is able to efficiently store and display information to the user.
